# Inheritance_OOP_Java
Java code to explain the concept of inheritance and method overiding. (OOP)
This repository contains my java project for a Hospital Class that uses inheritance. The structure of the Hospital and it's employees
for the sake of understanding is designed in such a way that the concept of inheritance in Java programming language can be implemented.
There are other class files with the .java extension that represent the hospital's employees like the Nurse, Doctor and Surgeon. 
The file Hosptial.java contains the main() method and by creating objects of several other methods and functions we are able to make 
the code run in unison with concepts like overiding, etc. There is this simple way to run the code by simply having all the java files in
your package and then simply running the Hospital.java file will give you the desired output. When we build/run the program, it invokes
several extended classes of the super class and also calls functions/methods in other classes and prints the final output on the screen.
Note: You should have all the files in the same package before running the Hospital.java or the file with the main() method to avoid any
errors.
